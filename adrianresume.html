<!--Leadership Paragraph-->
My name is Adrian Sheehy, and I am currently a Life Scout and Assistant Senior Patrol Leader in my Boy Scout Troop. 
I am a short distance away from the Eagle Scout rank, as I have completed my Eagle Scout project. 
My project was to build two gravel pathways in the traffic island at the Saint Edward's Church in Medfield. 
When crossing the grassy traffic island in the parking lot, elderly parishioners could slip and hurt themselves, and the gravel pathways created a safe traverse to the church.
Throughout my project, I have learned many great virtues that I would like to bring forward to this workplace. I learned the EDGE method, a teaching method commonly used by Boy Scouts.
EDGE stands for educate, demonstrate, guide and enable. An explanation of the EDGE method is at the end of the page.
In my own Eagle Scout project, I have used the EDGE method to enable scouts to build a gravel pathway. By working together, we completed both pathways that are used by parishioners today.
Through Boy Scouts I have learned many leadership skills, and have taken the National Youth Leadership course so that I can use my skills to benefit my community.

<h2>
My Educational Experience:
</h2>
<p>
In my school, I currently take four honors classes, and a computer science elective. Through this elective, I have learned JavaScript and basic HTML.
In my Computer Science class I am currently a team captain, and I have won the Cassidy Trophy because I have gone above and beyond when creating programs.
After school, I am part of Junior State of America and Mock Trial. Junior State of America, or JSA for short, is a club that teaches students the importance
of their civic duties, and its mission is to dissolve political apathy. Mock Trial is run by the Massachusetts Bar Association, and its mission is to educate students on the process
of our legal system. Students assume roles as lawyers and witnesses in a made up court case and work against another school. The school with the most compelling argument wins the case.
<br>
<strong>
In my free time I like to code many games on JavaScript through Khan Academy. Check one out down here:

<!--Edge Method-->
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
The EDGE Method:
</h2>
<ol>
<li>Educate. The first step is to verbally educate the person you are trying to teach</li>
<li>Demonstrate. The next step is to physically demonstrate your skill to help the other person visualize what to do.</li>
<li>Guide. The next step is to guide the other person through the skill. Through trial and effort, they will eventually learn the skill.</li>
<li>Enable. The final step is to enable the person. By doing this, they have now learned the skill, and are able to fluently perform it.</li>
</ol>
